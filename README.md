# Binarized Neural Networks on MATLAB

Binarized Neural Networks for Matlab 2019b and 2020a

Paper Implementation ("Hubara, Itay, et al. "Binarized neural networks." Advances in neural information processing systems. 2016.")

and little more works on image semantic segmentation with BNNs.

Application: CIFAR10 Classification & CamVid Segmentation.

*Don't forget to "add to path" before running the script.  
*Do not add both "0.Methods" at the same time.  
*Custom Training Loop only works on 2020a.    
*Custom Training Loop is not done yet.
